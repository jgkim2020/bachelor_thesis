	Abstract = {Walking-in-place (WIP) is a locomotion technique that allows users to travel in virtual environments (VEs) without significantly changing their physical position on the floor. Hip-directed steering(HDS) is a novel physical technique for controlling direction changes in virtual travel using hip movements. We present an WIP-based navigation approach for controlling locomotion in VEs that combines the speed and direction in a scenario similar to a domestic setup in which people interact with a flat screen. Their physical motion data are captured by one depth camera properly aligned with the screen and oriented toward the user. We approach the characteristically noisy data generated by depth cameras via a user study to determine both the range of values and their robustness from the motion data associated with the joints relevant to WIP speed(knee, ankle and foot) and HDS (spine, hip and shoulder) to derive a reliable technique. Our WIP speed method is supported in a simple vocabulary of five different footstep types. Experimental results show that both the knee and hip provide the most robust data. We evaluated our techniques via usability tests exercising common locomotion tasks. The results show that users liked both the speed control and comfort afforded by our speed method. Regarding HDS, users reported that the angular-based method allowed them to travel faster and was both more controllable and easier to learn than the time-based method. Our work shows that a single depth camera can be used to combine locomotion and direction control in a simple and affordable setup.},

	Abstract = {Redirected Walking, a new interactive locomotion technique for virtual environments (VEs), captures the benefits of real walking while extending the possible size of the VE. Real walking, although natural and producing a high subjective sense of presence, limits virtual environments to the size of the tracked space. Redirected Walking addresses this limitation by interactively and imperceptibly rotating the virtual scene about the user. The rotation causes the user to walk continually toward the furthest wall of the lab without noticing the rotation. We implemented the technique using stereo graphics and 3D spatialized audio. Observations during a pilot study suggest that the technique works: Redirected Walking causes people to change their real walking direction without noticing it, allows for larger VEs, and does not induce appreciable simulator sickness.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a novel orientation algorithm designed to support a computationally efficient, wearable inertial human motion tracking system for rehabilitation applications. It is applicable to inertial measurement units (IMUs) consisting of tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers, and magnetic angular rate and gravity (MARG) sensor arrays that also include tri-axis magnetometers. The MARG implementation incorporates magnetic distortion compensation. The algorithm uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimised gradient descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. Performance has been evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. Performance was also benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based algorithm of orientation sensor. Results indicate the algorithm achieves levels of accuracy matching that of the Kalman based algorithm; <; 0.8° static RMS error, <; 1.7° dynamic RMS error. The implications of the low computational load and ability to operate at small sampling rates significantly reduces the hardware and power necessary for wearable inertial movement tracking, enabling the creation of lightweight, inexpensive systems capable of functioning for extended periods of time.},

Walking-in-place (WIP) offers a natural and immer-sive form of virtual locomotion that can reduce simulation sickness. WIP, however, is difficult to implement in mobile contexts as it typically relies on bulky controllers or an external camera. We present VR-STEP; a WIP implementation that uses real-time pedometry to implement virtual locomo-tion. VR-STEP requires no additional instrumentation outside of a smartphone's inertial sensors.

	Abstract = {Walking in Place (WIP) is an important locomotion technique used in virtual environments. This paper proposes a new approach to WIP, called Speed-Amplitude-Supported Walking-in-Place (SAS-WIP), which allows people, when walking along linear paths, to control their virtual speed based on footstep amplitude and speed metrics. We argue that our approach allows users to better control the virtual distance covered by the footsteps, achieve higher average speeds and experience less fatigue than when using state-of-the-art methods based on footstep frequency, called GUD-WIP. An in-depth user evaluation with twenty participants compared our approach to GUD-WIP on common travel tasks over a range of short, medium and long dis-tances. We measured task performance using four distinct criteria: effectiveness, precision, efficiency and speed. The results show that SAS-WIP is both more efficient and faster than GUD-WIP when walking long distances while being more effective and precise over short distances. When asked their opinion via a post-test questionnaire, participants preferred SAS-WIP to GUD-WIP and reported experiencing less fatigue, having more fun and having a greater level of control when using our approach.},

	Abstract = {Many Virtual Environments require walking interfaces to explore virtual worlds much larger than available real-world tracked space. We present a model for generating virtual locomotion speeds from Walking-In-Place (WIP) inputs based on walking biomechanics. By employing gait principles, our model - called Gait-Understanding-Driven Walking-In-Place (GUD WIP) - creates output speeds which better match those evident in Real Walking, and which better respond to variations in step frequency, including realistic starting and stopping. The speeds output by our implementation demonstrate considerably less within-step fluctuation than a good current WIP system - Low-Latency, Continuous-Motion (LLCM) WIP - while still remaining responsive to changes in user input. We compared resulting speeds from Real Walking, GUD WIP, and LLCM-WIP via user study: The average output speeds for Real Walking and GUD WIP respond consistently with changing step frequency - LLCM-WIP is far less consistent. GUD WIP produces output speeds that are more locally consistent (smooth) and step-frequency-to-walk-speed consistent than LLCM-WIP.},

This paper describes a new WIP interface that improves both latency and the continuity of synthesized locomotion in the virtual environment. By basing the virtual avatar motion on the speed of the user's heel motion while walking in place, we create a direct mapping from foot-motion to locomotion that is responsive, intuitive, and easy to implement.

	Abstract = {This article presents an interactive technique for moving through an immersive virtual environment (or “virtual reality”). The technique is suitable for applications where locomotion is restricted to ground level. The technique is derived from the idea that presence in virtual environments may be enhanced the stronger the match between proprioceptive information from human body movements and sensory feedback from the computer-generated displays. The technique is an attempt to simulate body movements associated with walking. The participant “walks in place” to move through the virtual environment across distances greater than the physical limitations imposed by the electromagnetic tracking devices. A neural network is used to analyze the stream of coordinates from the head-mounted display, to determine whether or not the participant is walking on the spot. Whenever it determines the walking behavior, the participant is moved through virtual space in the direction of his or her gaze. We discuss two experimental studies to assess the impact on presence of this method in comparison to the usual hand-pointing method of navigation in virtual reality. The studies suggest that subjective rating of presence is enhanced by the walking method provided that participants associate subjectively with the virtual body provided in the environment. An application of the technique to climbing steps and ladders is also presented.},

With an outset in a taxonomy of virtual travel techniques, we argue that Walking-in-Place (WIP) techniques constitute a promising approach to virtual walking in relation to consumer IVR. Subsequently we review existing approaches to WIP locomotion and highlight the need for a more explicit focus on the perceived naturalness of WIP techniques; i.e., the degree to which WIP locomotion feels like real walking. Finally, we summarize work we have performed in order to produce more natural WIP locomotion and present unexplored topics which need to be address if WIP techniques are to provide perceptually natural walking experiences.},

  Abstract = {Ubiquitous computing systems aim to assist us as we go about our daily lives, whilst at the same time fading into the background so that we do not notice their presence. To do this they need to be able to sense their surroundings and infer context about the state of the world. Location has proven to be an important source of contextual information for such systems. If a device can determine its own location then it can infer its surroundings and adapt accordingly. Of particular interest for many ubiquitous computing systems is the ability to track people in indoor environments. This interest has led to the development of many indoor location systems based on a range of technologies including infra-red light, ultrasound and radio. Unfortunately existing systems that achieve the kind of sub-metre accuracies desired by many location-aware applications require large amounts of infrastructure to be installed into the environment. This thesis investigates an alternative approach to indoor pedestrian tracking that uses on-body inertial sensors rather than relying on fixed infrastructure. It is demonstrated that general purpose inertial navigation algorithms are unsuitable for pedestrian tracking due to the rapid accumulation of errors in the tracked position. In practice it is necessary to frequently correct such algorithms using additional measurements or constraints. An extended Kalman filter is developed for this purpose and is applied to track pedestrians using foot-mounted inertial sensors. By detecting when the foot is stationary and applying zero velocity corrections a pedestrian’s relative movements can be tracked far more accurately than is possible using uncorrected inertial navigation. Having developed an effective means of calculating a pedestrian’s relative movements, a localisation filter is developed that combines relative movement measurements with environmental constraints derived from a map of the environment. By enforcing constraints such as impassable walls and floors the filter is able to narrow down the absolute position of a pedestrian as they move through an indoor environment. Once the user’s position has been uniquely determined the same filter is demonstrated to track the user’s absolute position to sub-metre accuracy. The localisation filter in its simplest form is computationally expensive. Furthermore symmetry exhibited by the environment may delay or prevent the filter from determining the user’s position. The final part of this thesis describes the concept of assisted localisation, in which additional measurements are used to solve both of these problems. The use of sparsely deployed WiFi access points is discussed in detail. The thesis concludes that inertial sensors can be used to track pedestrians in indoor environments. Such an approach is suited to cases in which it is impossible or impractical to install large amounts of fixed infrastructure into the environment in advance.},

	Abstract = {To establish a supportive technology for reducing the risk of falling in older people, it is essential to clarify gait characteristics in elderly individuals that are possibly linked to the risk of falling during actual daily activities. In this study, we developed a system to monitor human gait in an outdoor environment using an inertial measurement unit consisting of a tri-axial accelerometer and tri-axial gyroscope. Step-by-step foot trajectories were estimated from the sensor unit attached to the dorsum of the foot. Specifically, stride length and foot clearance were calculated by integrating the gravity-compensated translational acceleration over time during the swing phase. Zero vertical velocity and displacement corrections were applied to obtain the final trajectory, assuming the slope of the walking surface is negligible. Short, normal, and long stride-length walking of 10 healthy participants was simultaneously measured using the proposed system and a conventional motion capture system to evaluate the accuracy of the estimated foot trajectory. Mean accuracy and precision were approximately 20 ± 50 mm, for stride length, and 2 ± 7 mm for foot clearance, indicating that the swing phase trajectory of the sensor unit attached to the foot was reconstructed more accurately and precisely using the proposed system than with previously published methods owing to the flat floor assumption. Although some methodological limitations certainly apply, this system will serve as a useful tool to monitor human walking during daily activities.},

	Abstract = {A detailed and quantitative gait analysis can provide evidence of various gait impairments in elderly people. To provide an objective decision-making basis for gait analysis, simple applicable tests analyzing a high number of strides are required. A mobile gait analysis system, which is mounted on shoes, can fulfill these requirements. This paper presents a method for computing clinically relevant temporal and spatial gait parameters. Therefore, an accelerometer and a gyroscope were positioned laterally below each ankle joint. Temporal gait events were detected by searching for characteristic features in the signals. To calculate stride length, the gravity compensated accelerometer signal was double integrated, and sensor drift was modeled using a piece-wise defined linear function. The presented method was validated using GAITRite-based gait parameters from 101 patients (average age 82.1 years). Subjects performed a normal walking test with and without a wheeled walker. The parameters stride length and stride time showed a correlation of 0.93 and 0.95 between both systems. The absolute error of stride length was 6.26 cm on normal walking test. The developed system as well as the GAITRite showed an increased stride length, when using a four-wheeled walker as walking aid. However, the walking aid interfered with the automated analysis of the GAITRite system, but not with the inertial sensor-based approach. In summary, an algorithm for the calculation of clinically relevant gait parameters derived from inertial sensors is applicable in the diagnostic workup and also during long-term monitoring approaches in the elderly population.},

The detection of end contact (EC), normally toe-off, and initial contact (IC) normally, heel strike was based on either foot linear accelerations or foot sagittal angular velocity or shank sagittal angular velocity. The results showed that all three methods were as accurate as foot switches in estimating times of IC and EC for normal gait patterns. In spinal-cord injured subjects, shank angular velocity was significantly less accurate (p<0.02).

For all supporting stimulation devices, it is vital to adequately detect the gait events, which is traditionally obtained by a foot switch placed under the heel. To investigate present methods of gait analysis and detection for use in ambulatory rehabilitation systems, we carried out a meta-analysis on research studies. We found various sensors and sensor combinations capable of analyzing gait in ambulatory settings, ranging form simple force based binary switches to complex setups involving multiple inertial sensors and advanced algorithms. However additional effort is needed to minimize donning/doffing efforts, to overcome cosmetical aspects, and to implement those systems into closed loop ambulatory devices.},
